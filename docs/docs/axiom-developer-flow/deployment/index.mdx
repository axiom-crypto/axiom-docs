# Deploying Your Axiom App

Once your Axiom client circuit and smart contract are tested and integrated, deploying your Axiom app requires a method for your users to query Axiom on-chain. There are three options for how to do this:

- **Web Frontend (recommended):** To allow users to query Axiom from your web frontend, you can integrate our [React component](/sdk/react-sdk/axiom-react) to prepare queries and submit them on-chain.
- **NodeJS Server:** To initiate queries into Axiom from your backend server, you can use our [NodeJS integration](/sdk/typescript-sdk/axiom-node-js).
- **Axiom CLI:** To try out an Axiom query directly from the command line using the Axiom SDK, you can use the [Axiom CLI](/sdk/typescript-sdk/axiom-cli).

For detailed instructions on how to deploy your app with each of these methods for querying into Axiom, see the pages below.
