# AxiomREPL

[AxiomREPL](https://repl.axiom.xyz/) is an in-browser REPL interface which allows you to prototype Axiom circuit code directly in the browser without creating a local project. It allows you to:

- Write an Axiom circuit function directly in the web browser.
- Compile and prove the Axiom circuit.
- See results from generating proofs in the Axiom circuit which would be sent to a callback function.
- Submit queries to the `AxiomV2Query` contract on Ethereum mainnet or `AxiomV2QueryMock` test contracts on Sepolia or Base Sepolia testnets.

AxiomREPL currently supports Ethereum mainnet, Sepolia testnet, and Base Sepolia testnet.

:::info
AxiomREPL has been tested and works as expected in Google Chrome, Brave, and Safari. AxiomREPL currently does not work in Firefox
