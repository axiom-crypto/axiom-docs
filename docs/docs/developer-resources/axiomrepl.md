# AxiomREPL

[AxiomREPL](https://repl.axiom.xyz/) is an in-browser REPL interface which allows you to prototype Axiom circuit code directly in the browser without creating a local project. It allows you to:

- Write an Axiom circuit function directly in the web browser.
- Compile and prove the Axiom circuit.
- See results from generating proofs in the Axiom circuit which would be sent to a callback function.
- Submit queries to the `AxiomV2QueryMock` test contract on Sepolia testnet.

AxiomREPL references data from Sepolia testnet.

AxiomREPL has been tested and works as expected in Google Chrome, Brave, and Safari. AxiomREPL currently does not work in Firefox
